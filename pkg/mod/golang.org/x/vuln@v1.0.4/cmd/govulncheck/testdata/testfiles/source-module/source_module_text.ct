Vulnerability #1: GO-2022-0969
    HTTP/2 server connections can hang forever waiting for a clean shutdown that
    was preempted by a fatal error. This condition can be exploited by a
    malicious client to cause a denial of service.
  More info: https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-0969
  Standard library
    Found in: net/http@go1.18
    Fixed in: net/http@go1.18.6

Vulnerability #2: GO-2021-0113
    Due to improper index calculation, an incorrectly formatted language tag can
    cause Parse to panic via an out of bounds read. If Parse is used to process
    untrusted user inputs, this may be used as a vector for a denial of service
    attack.

  Module: golang.org/x/text
    Found in: golang.org/x/text@v0.3.5
    Fixed in: golang.org/x/text@v0.3.7
